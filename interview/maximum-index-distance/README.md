# Maximum Index Distance

## Problem Statement
Given an array A[] of N positive integers. The task is to find the maximum of j - i subjected to the constraint of A[i] <= A[j].

## Input:
The first line contains an integer T, depicting total number of test cases.  Then T test case follows. First line of each test case contains an integer N denoting the size of the array. Next line contains N space separated integeres denoting the elements of the array.

## Output:
Print the maximum difference of the indexes i and j in a separtate line.

## Constraints:
```1 ≤ T ≤ 1000
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^7
0 ≤ A[i] ≤ 10^18```

## Example:
Input:
1
9
34 8 10 3 2 80 30 33 1

Output:
6

Explanation:
Testcase 1:  In the given array A[1] < A[7] satisfying the required condition(A[i] <= A[j]) thus giving the maximum difference of j - i which is 6(7-1).
